    <item>President Thomas S. Monson wrote an article for the youth on the topic of Friends, which says, “In a survey that was made in selected wards and stakes of the church, we learned a most significant fact. Those persons whose friends married in the temple usually married in the temple, while those persons whose friends did not marry in the temple usually did not marry in the temple. The influence of one’s friends appeared to be a more dominant factor than parental urging, classroom instruction, or proximity to a temple.\n\nWe tend to become like those whom we admire. Just as Nathaniel Hawthorne’s classic account ‘The Great Stone Face,’ we adopt the mannerisms, the attitudes, even the conduct of those whom we admire – and they are usually our friends. Associate with those who, like you, are planning not for temporary convenience, shallow goals, or narrow ambition but rather for those things that matter most – even eternal objectives.\n\nInscribed on an east wall of Stanford University Memorial Church is the truth ‘All that is not eternal is too short, and all that is not infinite is too small.’ Beyond your circle of earthly friends, I urge you to make a friend of your Heavenly Father. He stands ready to answer the prayer of your heart. Being the Father of your spirit and having created you in His own image, knowing the end from the beginning, His wisdom will not fail and His counsel is ever true. Make a friend of Him. There is another important friend you should have, and that is the bishop of your ward. He has been called of God by prophecy and the laying on of hands by those who are in authority. He is entitled to heavenly help in providing you with counsel and guidance. Make a friend of him.”\n\nIn the pamphlet For the Strength of the Youth, it says this about Friends, “Everyone needs good and true friends. They will be a great strength and blessing to you. They will influence how you think and act, and even help determine the person you will become. They will help you be a better person and will make it easier for you to live the gospel of Jesus Christ. Choose friends who share your values so you can strengthen and encourage each other in living high standards.\n\nTo have good friends, be a good friend. Show genuine interest in others; smile and let them know you care about them. Treat everyone with kindness and respect, and refrain from judging and criticizing those around you. Do not participate in any form of bullying. Make a special effort to be a friend to those who are shy or lonely, have special needs, or do not feel included.\n\nAs you seek to be a friend to others, do not compromise your standards. If your friends urge you to do things that are wrong, be the one to stand for the right, even if you stand alone. You may need to find other friends who will support you in keeping the commandments. Seek the guidance of the Holy Ghost as you make these choices.”\n\nHeavenly Father blesses you with friends so that you can rely on them. Heavenly Father is always there to comfort us &amp; desires for us to reach out to Him, but also provides us with friends so that we have a tangible support. We will find that one of our greatest reminders of how to have faith when we doubt, will come from inspiration as we pray, and many times the reminder will come from our friends. Righteous friends are the ones that you will remind you that Heavenly Father is always watching over you. These friends will show their ability to be righteous friends as you lean upon them in your times of need, and watch them direct you right back to your Heavenly Father. These are the types of friends to make. This is the type of friend to be to others. Remember, “He who walks with the wise will become wise. But the companion of fools will suffer harm.” Proverbs 13:20.</item>
    <item>Fear is a tool from the adversary to break us down. We also have tools to combat these feelings of fear and they are taught to us in the scriptures, from our Savior, and from our prophets.  2 Timothy 1: 7 reads, “For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.” President Gordon B. Hinckley said, “These principles mentioned in 2 Timothy 1:7 are great antidotes to the fears that rob us of our strength and sometimes knock us down to defeat. They give us power. What power? The power of the gospel, the power of truth, the power of faith, the power of the priesthood.” (First Presidency Message, October 1984).\n\nThe Savior has provided a way for us to escape every negative feeling, and He extends this promise to us in John 14:27, “Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you; not as the world gives, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.” Who better than the Savior to trust? It was after all, the Savior who said, “Be not afraid, only believe.”\n\nYou will at times feel doubt about your ability to succeed, doubt in yourself, and even doubt in the Gospel. Faith will play a pivotal role in your ability to overcome doubt. Never go one minute of feeling fear without sharing this concern with your Heavenly Father. Even a silent prayer in your mind is a prayer. The scriptures teach us to “Cast all your cares upon him; for He cares for you.” Peter 5:7.\n\nThere will be times when you find yourself feeling very lonely. When these times come remember, “The Lord is on my side; I will not fear. What can man do unto me?” Psalm 118:5&#8211;6. Ask yourself, ‘What can man do to me when I have the Lord on my side?’ This scripture teaches you that man can’t do anything to you when you have God on your side. Man will only overcome you as much as you allow them to. Do not put your trust in man, but put your trust in God. “The fear of man brings a snare; but whoso puts his trust in the Lord shall be safe.” Proverbs 29:25.\n\nThe First Presidency speaks directly to you Young Women of the church in the For the Strength of Youth Pamphlet where the topic of Faith is discussed. “By small and simple things are great things brought to pass.” Alma 37:6. “These standards are a guide to help you make correct choices. Review the standards often and ask yourself, ‘Am I living the way the Lord wants me to live?’ and ‘How have I been blessed by living these standards?’\n\nTo help you become all the Lord wants you to become, kneel each morning and night in prayer to your Father in Heaven. Express to Him your gratitude and the desires of your heart. He is the source of all wisdom. He will hear and answer your prayers. Study the scriptures each day and apply what you read to your life. The scriptures are a powerful source of personal revelation and guidance and a constant strength to your testimony.\n\nStrive each day to be obedient. Follow these standards, and encourage others to live them as well. Remember the covenant you have made and that you have the opportunity to renew each week when you partake of the sacrament. Strive to keep these covenants. If you make a mistake, don’t give up on yourself. Your Heavenly Father loves you and wants you to seek His help and keep trying. When possible, attend the temple and feel the joy and peace that come from serving in the house of the Lord. Prepare yourself for the temple covenants you will make in the future.”\n\nThe invitation is given to us about where we should go when we find ourselves doubting. Dieter F Uchtdorf said, “Jesus repeatedly emphasized the power of good thoughts and proper motives, ‘Look unto me in every thought, doubt not, fear not.” Doctrine &amp; Covenants 6:36. The testimony of Jesus Christ and the restored gospel will help us in our lives to learn of God’s specific plan for us and then to act accordingly. It gives us assurance of the reality, truth, and goodness of God, of the teachings and Atonement of Jesus Christ, and the divine calling of latter&#8211;day prophets. Our testimony motivates us to live righteously, and righteous living will cause our testimony to grow stronger.’”\n\nRemember to always have good thoughts. When times are hard and you find yourself doubting, lose yourself in acts of service for others.  If we find ourselves struggling with faith, the best thing to do is act. “Faith without works is dead.” James 2:20. Prayer is an action, and prayer is the best first step to take as you overcome fear.\n\nAnother key to overcoming doubt or fear is acknowledging that it is okay to seek out help. It is through our faith that we will believe in the Gospel, and it is best to focus on faith rather than doubt. Elder Jeffrey R Holland said, “When doubt or difficulty come, do not be afraid to ask for help.”\n\nWhy does Satan work so hard on our emotions to make us believe that we should entertain doubts when they come? To bring more clarity to your mind about what to do when a doubt comes, know first that Satan’s purpose of making you doubt is to pull you further away from the kingdom of God. This is why Satan works on our hearts.  Where do we find the kingdom of God? The Savior said, “Behold, the kingdom of God is within you.” Luke 17:21. Do not let Satan win over your hearts, or he will win over the most precious part of you.\n\nScripture study is another key in overcoming fear. Henry B Eyring asks the question, “What is the role of the Holy Ghost in scripture study?’ He responds to his own question, “The Holy Ghost confirms to us the word of God when we read it. That confirmation, repeated often, strengthens our faith. And it is by faith that we overcome obstacles and resist temptation.” (A Discussion on Scripture Study, July 2005)\n\n</item>

        <item>The Bible Dictionary says under the topic of Revelation, \"The Holy Ghost is a revelator.\” Joseph Smith said, \"No man can receive the Holy Ghost without receiving revelations. Without revelation, all would be guesswork, darkness, and confusion.\"\n\nIn November 1956 President David O. McKay asked all the members of the church this question: “If at this moment each one of you were asked to state in one sentence or phrase the most distinguishing feature of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter&#8211;day Saints, what would be your answer?” The response President McKay gave to his own question was the “divine authority” of the priesthood.\n\nIt is through the divine priesthood that the temples operate through the power of God. The temple is the House of God and is the place that Heavenly Father has set up for us go to receive the greatest source of personal revelation.\n\n\“Personal revelation is communication from God to His children on earth. Revelation may come through the Light of Christ and the Holy Ghost by way of inspiration, visions, dreams, or visits by angels. Revelation provides guidance that can lead the faithful to eternal salvation in the celestial kingdom.” (The Guide to the Scriptures: Revelation)\n\nDecide now and live daily knowing that you will one day enter the temple. By living with this conviction Satan will have less power over you. Elaine S. Dalton said, “Prepare now for the temple, the mountain of the Lord. Never allow the goal of the temple to be out of your sight. Walk into His presence in purity and virtue, and receive His blessings, ‘even all that He hath.’”\n\nEzra Taft Benson teaches that temples are a place of personal revelation, and also outlines how we can receive answers to our prayers and the most difficult problems in life. He says, “Temples are places of personal revelation. When I have been weighed down by a problem or a difficulty, I have gone to the House of the Lord with a prayer in my heart for answers. The answers have come in clear and unmistakable ways.”\n\nBy keeping our companionship with the gift of the Holy Ghost strong, we will be guided as how to prepare for the temple. In order for us to use the gift of the Holy Ghost to receive personal revelation, we must be worthy of the Holy Ghost’s companionship. At the time of our baptism we were confirmed with this gift and we continue this companionship by remaining worthy, and by renewing our baptismal covenants each week as we take the sacrament. Elder Dallin H. Oaks teaches us about how vital the constant companionship of the gift of the Holy Ghost is. He states the reason we take the sacrament weekly is to renew our baptismal covenants, and the reason we do this weekly is so we can always have His spirit to be with us. He says, “The direct, personal channel of communication to our Heavenly Father through the Holy Ghost is based on worthiness and is so essential, that we are commanded to renew our covenants by partaking of the sacrament each Sabbath day. In this way, we qualify for the promise that we may always have His spirit to be with us, to guide us.” (Two Lines of Communication, Ensign Feb 2010, Dallin H. Oaks)\n\nL. Lionel Kendrick said, “The temple is a place of holiness. It is the most sacred and holy place on earth and should be treated with the greatest degree of reverence and respect.” It is because of the sacred ordinances that take place in the House of the Lord that cause our minds to become reverent when we think of the temple. We should also remember that the ordinances of the sacrament are to be treated with the same reverence.\n\nWe are taught so many wonderful blessings about what the temple has to offer us, such as the ability to bear our burdens and overcome temptation with greater strength. Thomas S. Monson said, “As we go to the holy house, as we remember the covenants we make therein, we will be able to bear every trial and overcome very temptation.”\n\nThe temple is also a place of healing. Wendy Ulrich said the following in her book ‘The Temple Experience’, \"Like a good Samaritan, Jesus invites us to the temple as to an inn of sanctuary where our spiritual and psychic wounds are cleansed, anointed, and dressed. He says to the Nephites who less righteous comrades had been destroyed prior to his coming, \"O all ye that are spared because ye were more righteous than they, will ye not now return unto me, and repent of your sins, and be converted, that I may heal you?\" (3 Nephi 9:13). Conversion, repentance, and healing are intertwined.\" Notice how Jesus never tells us we will be cured, but only healed. To be cured means we are restored to the position we were originally at, but we did not grow. This is why Jesus \‘heals’ us, so that not only are we cured, but we are made better and we will remember the gift of being healed that has been given to us by Heavenly Father. Let us never be afraid to repent, just as the wicked Nephites were invited to do by the Savior so that they could enter His holy house and be healed.\n\nJames E. Faust urges us to do whatever we can to one day enter the temple. “I urge all who have not yet received these greatest of all blessings within the walls of the temple to do whatever may be necessary to qualify to receive them.”\n\nWhen trying to teach others about the importance of the Gospel, you may find they are not as receptive to listening while in a position where man can sway them away from the Gospel. We are taught how to put others in a position of being receptive. \"You may talk to the Saints about the follies of the world&#8230;till dooms day, and it will make no impression. But&#8230;place them in a position where they will get the Holy Ghost, and that will be a sure protection against outside influences.\" Eliza R Snow, \'Woman\'s Exponent\' September 15, 1873, page 63.\n\nWe are promised we will love our families with a deeper love by attending the temple. “When you come to the temple, you will love your family with a deeper love than you have ever felt before. The temple is about families.” Richard H. Winkel.\n\nWhen the time comes in our lives that we stand in great need of God’s intervention and assistance, we can take our plea to the temple. “In my distress I called upon the Lord, and cried to my God; and He did hear my voice out of His temple, and my cry did enter His ears.” 2 Samuel 22:7. If you are feeling lost, remember that this feeling can be overpowered when you go to the temple. “You are never lost when you can see the temple. The temple will provide direction for you and your family in a world filled with chaos. It is an eternal guidepost which will help you from getting lost in the ‘mist of darkness.’” Gary E. Stevenson.\n\nWhen you are filling like life is too burdensome, and instead of enjoying life all you are doing is enduring life, remember the growth that God intends you to have which is why He gives us trials. “All that we suffer and all that we endure, especially when we endure it patiently, builds up our characters, purifies our hearts, expands our souls, and makes us more tender and charitable, more worthy to be called the children of God. It is through sorrow and suffering, toil and tribulation, that we gain the education that we came here to acquire and which will make us more like our Father and Mother in Heaven,” Orson F. Whitney.\n\nPreparing for the temple is something we must do every day. We must strive to live as a witness of Jesus Christ as we covenanted to do at baptism. We must stand worthy of the temple. Mary N. Cook said, “Just as the Salt Lake Temple took 40 years to build, stone by stone, you are building a virtuous life, step by step.” Our theme for this year’s Girls Camp ‘Step by Step,’ comes from this temple quote.\n\nAfter entering the temple for the first time and every time going forward, we will have the spiritual reminder of how clean we are. In the book ‘Your Endowment’ by Mark A. Shields he says, “My first real impression after receiving my endowment was not one of spiritual understanding, but of cleanliness. I felt clean, so clean that my lack of understanding about the endowment didn’t really bother me. Sure, I was determined to learn what the Lord was trying to teach me, but I very much enjoyed basking in the Spirit and the cleanliness I felt.”\n\nAll of these blessings of cleanliness, worthiness, revelation, the Spirit, overcoming trials and temptations, and any more that pertain to you personally, will mean more to you as you follow promptings from the Holy Ghost. The covenants we made at baptism at the young age of 8 gives us many years of learning to recognize promptings from the Holy Ghost and receive personal revelation, before we make the step of going through the temple and receiving the gift of our Endowment. Personal revelation is key in the temple, and as we strengthen our relationship with the Holy Ghost by seeking after personal revelation and following all the promptings that we have, we will be better prepared for the temple and the revelation that can come there. The temple will become a richer experience for us based on our preparation before entering. We are the only ones who will limit the amount of personal revelation we can receive. “Even the least Saint may know all things as fast as he is able to bear them.” (Teachings, page 149)\n\nThe Holy Ghost will guide us about when we are to take the step of entering the temple and receiving the gift of our endowment. The Holy Ghost will be able to better speak this prompting to us when are seeking after his companionship. We will know at the time of this prompting that we are ready to make those temple covenants and keep them. We are taught how to keep our temple covenants in the Temple Preparation Teacher’s Manual. It says, “A covenant is a scared agreement between God and a person or group of people. God sets specific conditions and He promises to bless us as we obey these conditions. When we choose not to keep covenants, we cannot receive the blessings.”\n\nBy daily righteous living, we will find that our hearts will increase in desire to enter the temple as we become more connected to Heavenly Father and more disconnected from the wicked world in which we live. Righteous living will cause us to want to be in the temple to feel of the purity that is there. Joseph B. Wirthlin said, “As we come unto Christ and journey to higher ground, we will desire to spend more time in His temples, because the temples represent higher ground, sacred ground.”\n\nDavid A. Bednar said, “Within the sound of my voice are many young women, young men, and children. I plead with you to be worthy, to be steadfast, and to look forward with great anticipation to the day you will receive the ordinances and blessings of the temple.”\n\nRemember what covenants you have made up to your point in this life. How are you renewing your covenants? Are you doing more than only renewing your baptismal covenants each Sunday? Are you striving to act as a witness of Jesus Christ at all times? Do you strive to live righteously? Do you strive to have the Holy Ghost to always be with you &amp; do you understand this is a direct blessing given to us each week as we take the sacrament? If we keep our baptismal covenants, we will have His spirit to be with us. Challenge yourself to be a daily covenant keeper. This type of preparation is the best preparation you can give yourself in preparing for the temple. The temple is richer for us when we remember our covenants daily and integrate them into our daily actions. Seek after personal revelation now to exercise your gift in understanding how the Holy Ghost speaks to you and by doing this, you will have greater temple experiences.\n\nWhat would happen to us if we did not have personal revelation? We are told in Proverbs 29:18, “Where there is no vision, the people perish.” We are told of the power that comes with personal revelation in 2 Nephi 32:5, “The Holy Ghost will show unto you all things.” The vast differences in these scriptures from what comes by not having revelation versus the limitless possibilities of having it, show us the outcome of our happiness should we choose to seek after personal revelation compared to not seeking after it.\n\nWhen we seek after personal revelation and our relationship with Heavenly Father, it helps us to understand how Heavenly Father seeks after us. This principle is outlined in Doctrine &amp; Covenants 88:63 and quoted by Mark A Shields in his book ‘Your Endowment.’ He says, \"The simplest way I know of to describe how covenants work, is to say that we do our part, and the Lord does His. Between these two actions, man is brought together with God. This principle is illustrated by the Lord Himself in D&amp;C 88:63 where He says, \"Draw near unto me, and I will draw near unto you; seek me diligently and ye shall find me; ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.\" In all of these instances, the Lord is the second participant who bestows the blessing. After we draw near to Him, He draws near to us. After we seek, He reveals. After we ask, He gives. After we knock, He opens.”\n\n</item>

        <item>The Church says the following about temptation, “Temptation is a test of a person’s ability to choose good instead of evil. It is an enticement to sin and follow Satan instead of God. Part of the experience of this life is to learn to overcome temptation and to choose right over wrong. Since the Fall of Adam and Eve, people have had an inclination to follow earthly desires and to succumb to appetites and passions. This life was given as a time in which God’s children could learn to use their agency to overcome temptation and to choose of their own free will to follow Jesus Christ.”\n\nGordon B. Hinckley spoke to the Young Women of the church in a general broadcast in May of 2004 titled ‘Stay On the High Road.’ He shared this message with the Young Women, “You are second to none. You are daughters of God. There has come to you as your birthright something beautiful and sacred and divine. Never forget that. Your Eternal Father is the great Master of the universe. He rules over all, and He also will listen to your prayers as His daughter, and hear you as you speak with Him. He will answer your prayers. He will not leave you alone. In my quiet moments, I think of the future with all of its wonderful possibilities and with all of its terrible temptations. I wonder what will happen to you in the next 10 years. Where will you be? What will you be doing? That will depend on the choices you make, some of which may seem unimportant at the time but which will have tremendous consequences. Someone has said, “It may make a different to all eternity whether we do right or wrong today.” (Elbert Hubbard’s Scrapbook, James Freeman Clarke).\n\nPresident Hinckley continues, “As you walk the road of life, be careful of your friends. They can make or break you. Be generous in helping the unfortunate and those in distress. But bind to you the friends of your own kind, friends who will encourage you, stand with you, live as you desire to live; who will enjoy the same kind of entertainment; and who will resist the evil that you determine to resist. To accomplish His plan of Happiness, the Great Creator planted within us an instinct that makes boys interested in girls and girls interested in boys. That powerful inclination can lead to beautiful experiences, or it can lead to terribly ugly experiences. As we look over the world, it seems that morality has been cast aside. The violation of old standards has become common. Studies, one after another, show that there has been an abandonment of time&#8211;tested principles. Self&#8211;discipline has been forgotten, and promiscuous indulgence has become widespread. But, my dear friends, we cannot accept that which has become common in the world. Yours, as members of this Church, is a higher standard and more demanding. It declares as a voice from Sinai that thou shalt not indulge. You must keep control of your desires. For you there is no future in any other course. I should modify that to say that the Lord has provided for repentance and forgiveness. Nonetheless, yielding to temptation can become like a wound that seems never to heal and always to leave an ugly scar.”\n\nThere are many times temptation will be hard. We are told that when we endure temptation, we will be blessed. James 1:12, “Blessed is the man that endureth temptation; for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.”\n\nPrayer is the greatest facilitator, next to righteous living, that will keep us in line with finding the strength to overcome temptation. We have been warned to “Pray always, lest you enter into temptation and lose your reward,” Doctrine &amp; Covenants 31:12. The scriptures also tell us to overcome temptation &amp; evil by making good choices, “Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.” Romans 12:21.\n\nWe are promised many blessings when we overcome temptation. “He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God and he shall be my son,” Revelation 21:7.\n\nEven Jesus experienced temptation in all its forms. Alma prophesied, “….he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and sicknesses of his people.” Alma 7:11. And the angel told King Benjamin that Jesus would “Suffer temptations, and pain of body, hunger, thirst, and fatigue, even more than man can suffer, except it be unto death,” Mosiah 3:7.\n\nWe read that Jesus “was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.” Hebrews 4:15. And Abinadi declared that Jesus “suffereth temptation, and yieldeth not to the temptation…” Mosiah 15:5. And it was revealed to Joseph Smith in Doctrine &amp; Covenants 20:22 that Jesus “suffered temptations but gave no heed unto them.”\n\nThe Lord knows how to rescue us from the power of temptation, and since the devil has this great ability to tempt and entice us, it is necessary that we know the way of deliverance and how to escape from the devil’s power. We read that Jesus suffered temptation “that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.” Alma 7:12.\n\nPeter said that “the Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations.” 2 Peter 2:9, and in these last days the Lord has given assurance that He “knoweth the weakness of man and how to succor them who are tempted.” Doctrine and Covenants 62:1. God will never abandon us.\n\nHere are some ways that the Lord has designed to protect His people from the temptations of Satan.\n\nFirst is taught in James 4:7, “Submit yourselves there to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.” When Jesus resisted temptation, the tempter himself began to lose confidence and even began to plead in his attempts to win over Jesus. At first Satan taunted Jesus by saying, “If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.” That did not work so Satan tried another approach. “If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down from the temple.” Again he was rebuffed by Jesus so Satan attempted even stronger by saying, “All these things (the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them) will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.” Again Jesus rebuffed him and “then the devil leaveth him.” Matthew 4:3&#8211;11.\n\nWe can see that the scriptures teach us, “Blessed is the man that endureth (resists) temptation.” James 1:12. Alma teaches us how to resist temptation. “Withstand every temptation of the devil, with our faith on the Lord Jesus Christ.” Alma 37:33. Prayer is a defense against the power of temptation. Jesus said, “Ye must watch and pray always, lest ye be tempted by the devil, and ye be led away captive by him, let ye enter into temptation; for Satan desireth to have you, that he may sift you as wheat.” 3 Nephi 18:15, 18.\n\nMoroni counsels us, “Be wise in the days of your probation; strip yourselves of all uncleanliness; ask with a firmness unshaken that ye will yield to no temptations, but that ye will serve the true and living God.” Mormon 9:28. Alma also shares, “Be watchful unto prayer continually, that ye may not be led away by the temptation of the devil, that he may not overpower you, for behold, he rewards you no good thing.” Alma 34:39.\n\nWe are taught that some of God’s children will not use this help that is available to them, and because of this they will not be granted the same strength available to them to overcome temptation. “Neither would they observe the performances of the church to continue in prayer and supplication to God daily, that they might not enter into temptation.” Alma 31:10. Added to this, the Lord has provided a way for His saints to be shielded from temptation. “There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.”\n\n1 Corinthians 10:13. “Humble yourselves before the Lord, and call on his holy name, and watch and pray continually, that ye may not be tempted above that which ye can bear, and thus be led by the Holy Spirit.” Alma 13:28.\n\nWhen we sin, God will chasten us to repentance and then show an increase of love. A direct result of sin is chastening from our loving Heavenly Father, that we may be forgiven and blessed. God teaches us that He chastens us after we sin to cause us to want to repent, and that even though repentance can be painful, afterwards we will have complete peace. “Verify, thus saith the Lord unto you, whom I love I also chasten that their sins may be forgiven, for with the chastisement I prepare a way for their deliverance in all things out of temptation.” Doctrine &amp; Covenants 95:1. “If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the Father chasteneth not? Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous; nevertheless afterward it yieldeth peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.” Hebrews 12:7, 11.\n\nTo the faithful, God has said, “Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.” Revelation 3:10. The Apostle Paul teaches it precisely, “Be not overcome of evil; but overcome evil with good.” Romans 12:21.\n\nThrough obedience to the Lord’s commandments and being willing to receive correction from his Priesthood servants on the earth (Bishops, Stake Presidents), one may obtain, “The Holy Spirit of promise, whereby ye are sealed up unto the day of redemption, that ye may not fall notwithstanding the hour of temptation that may come upon you.” Doctrine &amp; Covenants 124:124.\n\nThe scriptures teach us that we should help each other overcome temptation and one of the best ways to do this is by praying for them. Jesus said this to Peter, “Behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not; and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.” Luke 22:31&#8211;32.\n\nGod has affection on those who sin and directs us as His children that seek after Him to help those who sin become humble. If our fellow Saints that sin are not in a position to listen to us, then this is best done by living a good example for them to see. They will see the happiness that comes from righteous living. Paul taught, “Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted. Bear ye one another’s burden, and so fulfill the law of Christ.” Galatians 6:1&#8211;2.\n\nGod tells us that He has given us all things so that we can labor to those who are weaker than us. “I have shewed you all things, how that so laboring ye ought to support the weak.” Acts 20:35. As Jesus has helped us, we should help each other. How should we deal with temptation? Avoid it, resist it, and pray for help from God. And through the grace of Christ, we will overcome it.\n\n</item>

Wirthlin\n\n"Let us truly be a temple&#8211;attending and a temple&#8211;loving people….Let us make the temple, with temple worship and temple covenants and temple marriage, our ultimate earthly goal and the supreme mortal experience." – Howard W. Hunter\n\n"There is a difference in just attending the temple and having a rich spiritual experience. The real blessings of the temple come as we enhance our temple experience. To do so, we must feel a spirit of reverence for the temple and a spirit of worship." – L. Lionel Kendrick\n\n"As we go to the holy house, as we remember the covenants we make therein, we will be able to bear every trial and overcome each temptation." – Thomas S. Monson\n\n"Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled with the Holy Ghost." 3 Nephi 12:6\n\nYou will know when you are ready to enter the temple, you will be prompted. “This is at the very heart of our sacred work – to feel a spiritual impression and be willing to follow it.” – Elder Neil L. Anderson\n\n"Throughout life we all face various situations in which we must decide: Do we choose God and His temple, or the world and its enticements (money, power, fame, etc). If we go down the world\'s path, the road back to true peace becomes more difficult to find. Lasting peace comes not from the slippery riches of the world but only from the Prince of Peace&#8211; who is always found in His peaceful home, the holy temple. There we can grow in understanding of why we are here, what we are to do here, and what will happen to us when we leave. When we have this eternal perspective, we can always be at peace, even through the storms of this life." John H Groberg \'Refuge and Reality, the Blessings of the Temple\' page 164\n\n"The temple is a place of holiness. It is the most sacred and holy place on earth and should be treated with the greatest degree of reverence and respect." – L. Lionel Kendrick\n\n"When you attend the temple and perform the ordinances that pertain to the House of the Lord, certain blessings will come to you: you will receive the Spirit of Elijah, which will turn your hearts to your spouse, to your children, and to your forebears; you will love your family with a deeper love than you have loved before; your hearts will be turned to your fathers and theirs to you; you will be endowed with a power from on high as the Lord has promised; you will receive the key of knowledge of God (see D&amp;C 84:19), and you will learn how to be like Him. Even the power of Godliness will be manifest to you (see D&amp;C 84:20). Such are the blessings of the temple and the blessings of frequently attending the temple." Ezra Taft Benson\n\n"When you come to the temple you will love your family with a deeper love than you have ever felt before. The temple is about families." – Richard H. Winkel\n\n"I promise you that, with increased attendance in the temples of our God, you shall receive increased personal revelation to bless your life as you bless those who have died." – Ezra Taft Benson\n\nDo we ever feel that life or our trials are too hard to understand? In reading our scriptures, are they too hard to understand? How should we seek answers to these things? If we come to God humble as a little child, we will be in the best position to receive answers. The Prophet Joseph Smith said, “We may come to Jesus and ask Him; and He will know all about it. If he comes to a little child, he will adapt himself to the language and capacity of a little child. The Lord deals with his people as a tender parent with a child, communicating light and intelligence and the knowledge of his ways as they can bear it. We can drop the pose and habits of our tough&#8211;minded intellect and know that we may listen as a little child, having confidence that the Gospel is simple. Listen for the voice of testimony, listen like a humble child, listen with the intent to obey, then obey, and then have confidence that your capacity to find the safe path – the ability to see and to choose the right – will grow at least in proportion to the confusion ahead.” Henry B. Eyring, To Draw Closer to God, page 33 and 35\n\n"Temples are places of personal revelation. When I have been weighed down by a problem or a difficulty, I have gone to the House of the Lord with a prayer in my heart for answers. The answers have come in clear and unmistakable ways." – Ezra Taft Benson\n\n"At the temple the dust of distraction seems to settle out, the fog and the haze seem to lift, and we can \'see\' things that we were not able to see before and find a way through our troubles that we had not previously known." – Boyd K. Packer\n\n“I know your lives are busy. I know that you have much to do. But I make you a promise that if you will go to the house of the Lord, you will be blessed; life will be better for you.” – Gordon B. Hinckley\n\n"Everything that occurs in the temple is uplifting and ennobling. It speaks of life here and life beyond the grave. It speaks of the importance of the individual as a child of God. It speaks of the importance of the family and the eternity of the marriage relationship." – Gordon B. Hinckley\n\n"There, in the house of the Lord, you can learn what you need to know to be truly free. There, tucked away from turmoil and strife, is the chance to be totally unselfish—a rarity in today\'s world." – Robert L. Simpson\n\n"It is in the ordinances of the temple that we are placed under covenant to Him….[If] we will enter into our covenants without reservation or apology, the Lord will protect us. We will receive inspiration sufficient for the challenges of life." – Boyd K. Packer\n\nThere are four steps to listening. The first is learn ‘what’ to listen for, the second is learn ‘how’ to listen. The third is to ‘listen with the intent of doing what you are told.’ The fourth is to ‘keep listening.’ Part of enduring to the end is to never get over being teachable even after you have lived and learned a lot. We should never become content in our understanding, as we are warned by Joseph Smith. He says, “When you climb up a ladder, you must begin at the bottom, and ascend step by step, until you arrive at the top; and so it is with the principles of the Gospel – you must begin with the first, and go on until you learn all the principles of exaltation. But it will be a great while after you have passed through the veil before you will have learned them. It is not all to be comprehended in this world; it will be a great work to learn our salvation and exaltation even beyond the grave.” To Draw Closer to God, Henry B. Eyring, page 34.\n\n“You are remarkable, even among those who chose right in the contest in the spirit world. You were among the brave, the faithful, and the true in that conflict. You qualified to come into mortality and to make this journey at a time when the gospel of Jesus Christ was on the earth. And among the billions of Heavenly Father’s children now living, you were privileged to find the gospel of Jesus Christ and his true church. You have chosen to make the journey of life walking in the light. Every child of Heavenly Father born in the world is given at birth, as a free gift, the Light of Christ. You have felt that. It is the sense of what is right and what is wrong and what is true and what is false. That has been with you since your journey in life began. The fact that you were baptized and received the Holy Ghost is evidence that you chose to walk in the Light of Christ.” Henry B. Eyring, To Draw Closer to God, page 29.\n\nWhat is the purpose of our white temple clothing? “White is a symbol of the Creator, light, joy, purity, innocence, glory and perfection. White is associated with the concepts of righteousness, holiness, victory, light, and revelation. Beyond these, white is equated with happiness, the presence of the Holy Ghost, and spiritual dedication. White is a reflection of all the beautiful colors of heaven, so too our lives must reflect the beauty of the Savior’s Gospel. White is a symbol of the sacred or divine. The changing of one’s clothes is a public statement about an inner transition, a transition of heart, mind and desires, mentally, physically and spiritually. One avoids bringing physical filth into God’s house  and the donning of white apparel means we are aware we are entering into a covenant to be new or different from before. We change into clothing of white, symbolic of the Atonement cleansing us. Hugh Nibley said, “When we enter the temple, we leave one world and enter into another. If Latter Day Saints are going to continue building temples, they must make up their minds as to which world they are going to live in.” The transition from street clothes to sacred clothes symbolizes which world we decide we are going to live in. White temple clothing implies a rejection of the world and its ways. White clothing symbolizes equality in the sight of God that creates unity and oneness in His children.” Alonzo L. Gaskill, Sacred Symbols.\n\n"I urge all who have not yet received these greatest of all blessings within the walls of the temple to do whatever may be necessary to qualify to receive them." – James E. Faust\n\n“Enter this door as if the flood were gold;\nAnd every wall of jewels all of wealth untold;\nAs if a choir in robes of fire were singing here;\nNo shout nor rush, but hush, for God is here.”\n&#8211;Spencer W. Kimball\n\n</item>

        <item>We are daughters of our Heavenly Father who loves us and we love Him. This phrase said out loud each week lets you hear yourself say that “God loves me,” and you also hear yourself say that “you love Him.” You are a direct daughter of God and your spiritual lineage puts Him directly above you as your Father. Next you promise to stand as a witness at all times. This phrase is taken directly from the scripture in Mosiah 18: 8&#8211;10 where Alma teaches us that as we desire to come into God’s fold and stand as a witness of Him, there are blessings we receive in return. Do you desire to be counted in God’s fold? Do you desire to stand as a witness of God? Alma says all these desires mean you are desiring to be baptized. The scripture says:\n\n“As ye are desirous to come into the fold of God, and to be called his people, and are willing to bear one another’s burdens that they may be light; Yea, and are willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea and comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things and in all places that ye may be in, even until death, that ye may be redeemed of God, and be numbered with those of the first resurrection, that ye may have eternal life. Now I say unto you, if this be the desire of your hearts, what have you against being baptized in the name of the Lord, as a witness before him that ye have entered into a covenant with him, that ye will serve him and keep his commandments that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you?”\n\nAlma is telling us that if we desire these things, why would we want anything else than to be baptized so that we can have the blessing of exactly what Alma says, which is to ‘have his Spirit poured out more abundantly upon you?’ Notice how it says that if we are baptized we’ll have the Spirit ‘more abundantly.’ This teaches that the Spirit is already poured out to us, but by being baptized, now we can have his Spirit ‘more abundantly.’ It is also important to remember that when we take the sacrament, which is the ordinance of renewing our covenants we made at baptism, we promise to always remember him. “Always remembering Him means that we always remember that nothing is hidden from Him,” D. Todd Christofferson.\n\nNow we will learn about the principles in the Young Women’s Theme.</item>
        <item>&#8211; Alma 32:21 says “Faith is not to have a perfect knowledge of things; therefore if ye have faith ye hope for things which are not seen, which are true.” What more do you youth need right now in your life than God’s reminder by believing in Him is believing in something true?\n&#8211; The Bible Dictionary teaches this about Faith: “Faith must be centered in Jesus Christ in order to produce salvation. To have faith is to have confidence in something or someone. Faith is kindled by hearing the testimony of those who have faith (Romans 10:14&#8211;17).  Faith comes by righteousness. Faith is a principle of action and of power, and by it one can command the elements, heal the sick, and influence any number of circumstances when occasion warrants (Jacob 4:4&#8211;7). Even more important, by faith one obtains a remission of sins and eventually can stand in the presence of God. True faith always moves its possessor to some kind of physical and mental action; it carries an assurance of the fulfillment of the things hoped for. A lack of faith leads one to despair, which comes because of iniquity. Where there is true faith there are miracles, visions, dreams, healings, and all the gifts of God that He gives to His saints.”\n&#8211; What do the scriptures teach us about faith? “By faith we understand the word and work of God. By faith, men subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, and worked miracles.” Hebrew Chapter 11. Other very good scriptures to read at Alma 32: 17&#8211;43, Ether 12: 6&#8211;22, and Joseph Smith – History 1: 11&#8211;20.\n&#8211; Exercise your own faith by establishing a habit of prayer in your life. Begin by saying regular morning and evening prayers.\n&#8211; Discover the principles of faith taught by the mothers of the Helaman’s stripling warriors. Read Alma 56: 45&#8211;48 and 57:21. The powerful teaching of faith from a mother to her children has a powerful impact.</item>
        <item>&#8211; As a child of God you have inherited divine qualities. What are some of your divine qualities? You can read 2 Peter 1; Alma 7:23&#8211;24; Doctrine &amp; Covenants 121:45.\n&#8211; What does it say about you in your patriarchal blessing? It will likely mention both your qualities from the pre&#8211;existence, and your divine qualities that you will carry with you on this earth and the blessings in the world to come through faithfulness.\n&#8211; As a female child of God you are also blessed with divine feminine qualities. We can learn of our feminine divine qualities by reading our patriarchal blessing, A Proclamation to the World as it outlines the qualities of a wife and mother. In Proverbs 31:10&#8211;31 it says what divine feminine qualities us women have. Your price is ‘far above rubies.’ It is your responsibility to seek after learning your divine qualities and work to strengthen them.\n&#8211; Good practice now in youth would be to seek out one family member and for two weeks, work to strengthen your relationship with them by showing love through your actions. Remember ‘you are learning to accept and act upon this value.’\n&#8211; Memorize the sacrament prayers (Doctrine &amp; Covenants 20: 77,79). During the sacrament, listen carefully to the prayers and think about what it means to take upon yourself the name of Jesus Christ, and how doing this should affect your actions and your decisions.\n&#8211; Obedience to God is also one of the key ways you will feel His hand and His presence guiding your life as you seek to understand your divine nature.  There is no other way during mortality that will shield you from the adversary than being completely secure in your divine nature. Know who YOU are the way God wants you to know.</item>
        <item>&#8211; Notice how some of these principles are given to us because God wants us to learn about ourselves. We are more capable of acting as a witness of the Savior if we’ve taken the time to learn our worth, our gifts, our divine nature.\n&#8211; “Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God.” Doctrine &amp; Covenants 18:10. Understanding that God knows you and loves you will help you feel your individual worth. You can read Psalm 8:4&#8211;6; Jeremiah 1:5; John 13:34; Abraham 3:22&#8211;23, Joseph Smith&#8211;History 1:1&#8211;20.\n&#8211; Your individual worth will be felt by you best when you are serving others and helping them feel of their worth. Do all you can to serve others. “If you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.”\n&#8211; Learning about your family history will help you understand your powerful and divine lineage from where you came.\n&#8211; Heavenly Father has given you special gifts that are unique to you. What are these special gifts? “Recognizing confirmations from the Spirit, obtaining wisdom, the ability to exercise exceedingly great faith, working mighty miracles, charity, believing &amp; enduring all things, acting on promptings from God, and most importantly the ability not to deny these gifts from God,” are only a few of the special gifts God has given you. Read 1 Corinthians 12:4&#8211;12, all of chapter 13; Moroni 7:12&#8211;13; 10:8&#8211;18; and Doctrine &amp; Covenants 46:11&#8211;26.\n&#8211;Have someone write down what strengths and attributes they see in you. Many times you will be aware of them but may have shrugged them off. Do not shrug them off, accept them. They are meant to be accepted.  Remember, ‘you are learning to accept and act upon this value.’</item>
        <item>&#8211; “Seek learning, even by study and also by faith.” Doctrine &amp; Covenants 88:118. Learn about the importance of gaining knowledge as taught to us in the scriptures. We can read Proverbs 1:5; 4:7; 2 Nephi 28:30; and Doctrine &amp; Covenants 88:78&#8211;80, 118; 90:15; 130:18&#8211;19. “A wise man will attain wise counsel; unto him that receiveth, I will give more; blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts; become acquainted with all good books; whatever principle of intelligence we attain in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.”\n&#8211; Some of the best knowledge you will obtain in this life will come from the experience of life. At a young age you may not believe that you can overcome a hard trial until you have, and then you will look back and see your growth. You will realize you did overcome that trial, and understand the knowledge you have gained. “I believe in Christ. So come what may.”</item>
        <item>&#8211; Agency, the ability to choose, is one of God’s greatest gifts to His children. Freedom of choice is essential to our existence and progression; 2 Nephi Chapter 2. You have the ability to make wise choices.\n&#8211; When we live righteously, we are bound to be blessed. “I the Lord am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise.” Doctrine &amp; Covenants 82:10.&#8211; “Feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do.” 2 Nephi 32:3\n&#8211; “Humble yourselves and continue in prayer unto Him. Let your hearts be full, drawn out in prayer unto him continually.” Alma 34: 19&#8211;27\n&#8211; In all things we must ask of God. “You have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought to ask me. You must study it out in your mind; then ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right. But if it not be right you shall have no such feelings.” Doctrine &amp; Covenants 9: 7&#8211;9.\n&#8211; The Holy Ghost will help you make correct choices. “But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things.” John 14:26.\n&#8211; The Holy Ghost is the best teacher on how we should live. “If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.” Galatians 5:25. “If ye will enter in by the way and receive the Holy Ghost, it will show unto you all things what ye should do.” 2 Nephi 32:5</item>
        <item>&#8211; Build the kingdom of God through righteous service. “Therefore let your light so shine before this people, that they may seek your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven.” 3 Nephi 12:16\n&#8211; Write down the quiet acts of service you see in your household that may go unnoticed or unmentioned. Strive to be a participant in these quiet acts of service, and the feel the reward of God’s blessings flood your heart.\n&#8211; Think of ways you can help others bear their burdens.\n&#8211; “The world has enough women who are tough; we need women who are tender. There are enough women who are coarse; we need women who are kind. There are enough women who are rude; we need women who are refined. We have enough women of fame and fortune; we need more women of faith. We have enough greed; we need more goodness. We have enough vanity; we need more virtue. We have enough popularity; we need more purity.” Margaret D. Nadauld.</item>
        <item>&#8211; Integrity is the willingness and desire to live by our beliefs and standards of the LDS church. Read Moroni 10: 30&#8211;33 and think about what it means to deny yourselves of all ungodliness.\n&#8211; How do the Lord’s standards differ from the world’s standards? What are your plans to live in accordance with the Lord’s standards? Remain worthy to attend the temple. Live daily knowing that you will one day attend the temple. Do not let Satan, temptation, or negative influence from others sway you from your decision to go through the temple. Their lack of understanding about power and peace that come from the House of God should not be the outcome for your future too. “Temple attendance has a calming, settling, consoling influence that distills peace and contentment.” Richard G. Scott.\n&#8211; Conduct a self&#8211;assessment of your personal integrity. Ask yourself the following questions: Do I avoid gossip, inappropriate jokes, swearing and profanity, being light&#8211;minded about sacred subjects? Am I completely truthful, morally clean, honest, dependable, trustworthy in all that I do? What are the areas you can improve? Develop uplifting habits and Christ&#8211;centered activities every day to invite the Holy Ghost. I encourage you to take these steps today. Your desire for the temple will increase as you live daily in accordance with Gospel living. Remember, the Lord desires for you to be in His House and Satan does not. Temptation is a sign that Satan is working to prevent you from receiving the blessings of the temple. Keep an eternal perspective always and remember why you are here on this earth. Even when pressured to do something contrary to the Gospel, the LDS young woman with integrity will not waver from her standards.</item>
        <item>&#8211; Virtue is remaining morally clean and sexually pure. Being virtuous will help young women prepare to go to the temple and fulfill future roles as wives and mothers. “More than ever before we need women of faith, virtue, vision and charity. We need women who have a spiritual confirmation of their identity, their value, and their eternal destiny. Above all, we need women who will stand up for truth and righteousness and decry evil at every turn.” M. Russell Ballard.\n&#8211; Modesty is a large part of staying chaste. “Modesty is the first line of defense for chastity.” Mark E. Petersen.\n&#8211; “Of all the creations of the Almighty, there is none more beautiful, none more inspiring than a lovely daughter of God who walks in virtue with an understanding of why she should do so.” Gordon B. Hinckley</item>
        <item>The theme continues with, “We believe as we come to accept and act upon these values.” The phrase ‘we believe as we come’ outlines that as time goes on, we will begin to understand better how to accept these values, then integrate them into our lives. In Doctrine &amp; Covenants 137:9 it says, “For I, the Lord, will judge all men according to their works, according to the desires of their hearts.” How will we ‘come to accept and act upon these values’ with our works? With the desires of our hearts?\n\nThe Young Women Theme is ultimately teaching us that it is after we come to accept and act upon all of these values that these things will happen: First, “we will be prepared to strengthen home and family;” Second, “we will be prepared to make and keep sacred covenants,” Third, “we will be prepared to receive the ordinances of the temple,” and the last blessing is Fourth, “enjoy the blessings of exaltation.”\n\n</item>

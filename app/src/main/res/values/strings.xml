    <string-array name="faith_friendships_body">
    <item>President Thomas S. Monson wrote an article for the youth on the topic of Friends, which says,
        In a survey that was made in selected wards and stakes of the church, we learned a most significant fact. Those persons whose friends
        married in the temple usually married in the temple, while those persons whose friends did not marry in the temple usually did not marry in the temple.
        The influence of one\'s friends appeared to be a more dominant factor than parental urging, classroom instruction, or proximity to a temple.\n\n

        We tend to become like those whom we admire. Just as Nathaniel Hawthorne\'s classic account The Great Stone Face, we adopt the mannerisms, the attitudes,
        even the conduct of those whom we admire &#8211; and they are usually our friends. Associate with those who, like you, are planning not for temporary
        convenience, shallow goals, or narrow ambition but rather for those things that matter most &#8211; even eternal objectives.\n\n

        Inscribed on an east wall of Stanford University Memorial Church is the truth All that is not eternal is too short, and all that is not infinite is too
        small. Beyond your circle of earthly friends, I urge you to make a friend of your Heavenly Father. He stands ready to answer the prayer of your heart. Being
        the Father of your spirit and having created you in His own image, knowing the end from the beginning, His wisdom will not fail and His counsel is ever true.
        Make a friend of Him. There is another important friend you should have, and that is the bishop of your ward. He has been called of God by prophecy and the
        laying on of hands by those who are in authority. He is entitled to heavenly help in providing you with counsel and guidance. Make a friend of him.\n\n

        In the pamphlet For the Strength of the Youth, it says this about Friends, Everyone needs good and true friends.
        They will be a great strength and blessing to you. They will influence how you think and act, and even help determine the person you will become. They will
        help you be a better person and will make it easier for you to live the gospel of Jesus Christ. Choose friends who share your values so you can strengthen and
        encourage each other in living high standards.\n\n

        To have good friends, be a good friend. Show genuine interest in others; smile and let them know you care about them. Treat everyone with kindness and
        respect, and refrain from judging and criticizing those around you. Do not participate in any form of bullying. Make a special effort to be a friend to
        those who are shy or lonely, have special needs, or do not feel included.\n\n

        As you seek to be a friend to others, do not compromise your standards. If your friends urge you to do things that are wrong, be the one to stand for the
        right, even if you stand alone. You may need to find other friends who will support you in keeping the commandments. Seek the
        guidance of the Holy Ghost as you make these choices.\n\n

        Heavenly Father blesses you with friends so that you can rely on them. Heavenly Father is always there to comfort us &amp; desires for us to
        reach out to Him, but also provides us with friends so that we have a tangible support. We will find that one of our greatest reminders of how to
        have faith when we doubt, will come from inspiration as we pray, and many times the reminder will come from our friends. Righteous friends are the ones that
        you will remind you that Heavenly Father is always watching over you. These friends will show their ability to be righteous friends as you lean upon them
        in your times of need, and watch them direct you right back to your Heavenly Father. These are the types of friends to make. This is the type of friend to
        be to others. Remember, He who walks with the wise will become wise. But the companion of fools will suffer harm. Proverbs 13:20.\n\n

        Fear is a tool from the adversary to break us down. We also have tools to combat these feelings of fear and they are
        taught to us in the scriptures, from our Savior, and from our prophets. 2 Timothy 1: 7 reads, For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and
        of a sound mind. President Gordon B. Hinckley said, These principles mentioned in 2 Timothy 1:7 are great antidotes to the fears that rob us of our
        strength and sometimes knock us down to defeat. They give us power. What power? The power of the gospel, the power of truth, the power of faith, the power of
        the priesthood.(First Presidency Message, October 1984).\n\n

        The Savior has provided a way for us to escape every negative feeling, and He extends this promise to us in
        John 14:27, Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you; not as the world gives, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be
        afraid. Who better than the Savior to trust? It was after all, the Savior who said, Be not afraid, only believe.\n\n

        You will at times feel doubt about your ability to succeed, doubt in yourself, and even doubt in the Gospel. Faith will play a pivotal role in your ability to
        overcome doubt. Never go one minute of feeling fear without sharing this concern with your Heavenly Father. Even a silent prayer in your mind is a
        prayer. The scriptures teach us to Cast all your cares upon him; for He cares for you. Peter 5:7.\n\n

        There will be times when you find yourself feeling very lonely. When these times come remember, The Lord is on my side; I will not fear. What can man do
        unto me? Psalm 118:5-6. Ask yourself, What can man do to me when I have the Lord on my side? This scripture teaches you that man can\'t do anything to you
        when you have God on your side. Man will only overcome you as much as you allow them to. Do not put your trust in man, but put your trust in God. The fear of
        man brings a snare; but whoso puts his trust in the Lord shall be safe.Proverbs 29:25.\n\n

        The First Presidency speaks directly to you Young Women of the church in the For the Strength of Youth Pamphlet where the topic of Faith is discussed.
        By small and simple things are great things brought to pass. Alma 37:6. These standards are a guide to help you make correct choices. Review the standards often and ask
        yourself, Am I living the way the Lord wants me to live? and How have I been blessed by living these standards?\n\n

        To help you become all the Lord wants you to become, kneel each morning and night in prayer to your Father in Heaven. Express to Him your gratitude and the
        desires of your heart. He is the source of all wisdom. He will hear and answer your prayers. Study the scriptures each day and apply what you read to your
        life. The scriptures are a powerful source of personal revelation and guidance and a constant strength to your testimony.\n\n

        Strive each day to be obedient. Follow these standards, and encourage others to live them as well. Remember the covenant you have made and that you have the
        opportunity to renew each week when you partake of the sacrament. Strive to keep these covenants. If you make a mistake, don\'t give up on yourself. Your
        Heavenly Father loves you and wants you to seek His help and keep trying. When possible, attend the temple and feel the joy and peace that come from serving
        in the house of the Lord. Prepare yourself for the temple covenants you will make in the future.\n\n

        The invitation is given to us about where we should go when we find ourselves doubting. Dieter F Uchtdorf said, Jesus repeatedly
        emphasized the power of good thoughts and proper motives, Look unto me in every thought, doubt not, fear not. Doctrine &amp; Covenants 6:36. The
        testimony of Jesus Christ and the restored gospel will help us in our lives to learn of God\'s specific plan for us and then to act accordingly. It gives us
        assurance of the reality, truth, and goodness of God, of the teachings and Atonement of Jesus Christ, and the divine calling of latter-day prophets. Our
        testimony motivates us to live righteously, and righteous living will cause our
        testimony to grow stronger.\n\n

        Remember to always have good thoughts. When times are hard and you find yourself doubting, lose yourself in acts of service for others. If we find ourselves struggling with
        faith, the best thing to do is act. Faith without works is dead. James 2:20. Prayer is an action, and prayer is the best first step to take as you overcome fear.\n\n

        Another key to overcoming doubt or fear is acknowledging that it is okay to seek out help. It is through our faith that we will believe in the Gospel,
        and it is best to focus on faith rather than doubt. Elder Jeffrey R Holland said, When doubt or difficulty come, do not be afraid to ask for help.\n\n

        Why does Satan work so hard on our emotions to make us believe that we should entertain doubts when they come? To bring more clarity to your mind about what
        to do when a doubt comes, know first that Satan\'s purpose of making you doubt is to pull you further away from the kingdom of God. This is why Satan works on
        our hearts. Where do we find the kingdom of God? The Savior said, Behold, the kingdom of God is within you. Luke 17:21. Do not let Satan win over your hearts, or he
        will win over the most precious part of you.\n\n

        Scripture study is another key in overcoming fear. Henry B Eyring asks the question, What is the role of the Holy Ghost in scripture study? He responds to his own
        question, The Holy Ghost confirms to us the word of God when we read it. That confirmation, repeated often, strengthens our faith. And it is by faith that we
        overcome obstacles and resist temptation. (A Discussion on Scripture Study, July 2005)\n\n</item>
